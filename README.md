# TinyList-React

## Basic Functions
 TinyList is a Task list page made using react. New tasks can be added and any new task will always be shown at the top of the list. When the checkbox is clicked, the task is pushed to the bottom of the list. When the checkboc is unchecked for any task, the is sent to its exact loaction where it was present before in the list. This is done through the created_at variable which stores the date and time at which the task was created. The list sorts the tasks based on created_at. Click on the text of any task to edit the task.\
 \
Currently no API is intergrated in TinyList. But any API can be easily integrated as the base code for integration is present.
